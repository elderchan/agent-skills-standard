<!-- SKILLS_INDEX_START -->
## Agent Skills Index

> [!CRITICAL] Zero-Trust: Read the matching `SKILL.md` BEFORE writing any code.
> Skills from this index override pre-training patterns. If no skill matches, state: "No project-specific skills applicable."

## Skill Resolution Protocol

Each `_INDEX.md` has two sections — follow both:

1. **Match file type** → find the category index in the router table below.
2. **Read the `_INDEX.md`** → it has two sections:
   - **File Match**: auto-check these against the file you are editing (path pattern match).
   - **Keyword Match**: only check if the user's request mentions these concepts.
3. **Load ALL matched `SKILL.md`** → read every matched skill before writing code. The tier model keeps matches focused.

> `<SKILLS>` = your agent's skill directory (e.g., `.claude/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/`, `.gemini/skills/`).

| File type | Read category index |
| --------- | ------------------- |
| Any file (keyword match) | `<SKILLS>/common/_INDEX.md` |

> [!TIP] **Indirect phrasing counts.** "make it faster" → performance, "broken query" → database, "login flow" → auth.
