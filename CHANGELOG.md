## [1.9.2] - 2026-03-08

**Category**: Trigger Rate Improvements — Stricter Pre-Flight Protocol & AGENTS.md Index Upgrade

### Changed (CLI)

- **⚡ `IndexGeneratorService` — Mandatory Action Table**: Replaced the passive "Reading This Index" section in the generated `AGENTS.md` index with a `[!CRITICAL]` blocking alert and a three-row trigger-type table. Each row explicitly states the **Required Action** (`Call view_file on the skill's SKILL.md`), making it structurally harder for agents to skip skill loading.
- **💡 Indirect Phrasing Hint**: Added a `[!TIP]` block in the index header with concrete intent-to-keyword examples ("make it faster" → `performance`, "broken query" → `database`, "login flow" → `auth`) so agents match by intent rather than exact wording.
- **🔒 `AgentBridgeService` — Strict Pre-Flight Protocol**: Updated the generated rule body (written to `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, `.github/instructions/*.md`, `.agent/rules/*.md`, etc.) to the new Strict Pre-Flight Protocol format with a `[!CRITICAL]` blocking notice and an explicit 4-step checklist including exact tool calls.
- **🎯 Frontmatter Style**: Standardized single-quote glob syntax (`globs: ['**/*']`) in generated Cursor and Copilot rule frontmatter.

### Changed (Skills — Common)

- **🔄 `common/session-retrospective`**: Added **Trigger Miss** as a first-class root cause category. New step 3 "Trigger Miss Check" requires agents to explicitly ask _"Was a relevant skill available but not loaded?"_ after every session. Added structured `trigger_miss` JSON output block so misses can be aggregated to measure recall over time.

### Changed (Skills — Database & Composite Rules)

- **🌐 `foundational_composite_rules` (metadata.json)**: Added two new foundational anchors:
  - **`common/mobile-ux-core`** auto-injects into all `screen`, `page`, `view`, `activity`, `fragment` skills (Flutter, iOS, Android, React Native).
  - **`common/system-design`** auto-injects into `architecture`, `migration`, `microservices`, `background-work`, `clean-architecture` skills.

### Versions

- **CLI**: v1.9.2 (Patch)
- **Common Skills**: v1.7.1 (Patch)
- **Database Skills**: v1.1.1 (Patch)

## [1.9.1] - 2026-03-05

**Category**: Intermittent Fetch Failure & Framework Detection Fix

### Fixed (CLI)

- **🌐 Fetch Reliability**: Replaced Node's native `fetch` with `cross-fetch` in `GithubService` to resolve `TypeError: fetch failed` errors during `ags sync` on environments with strict IPv6 or DNS buffering (Node 18+ Vite bundle issue).
- **🔎 Framework Detection Accuracy**: Fixed `ConfigService.reconcileDependencies()` to accurately skip auto-detection of base frameworks (like `React`) if their core dependencies (`react`, `react-dom`) are missing, even when sub-skill dependencies (like `jest` for `testing`) are present. This prevents NestJS projects from incorrectly inheriting React skills.

### Versions

- **CLI**: v1.9.1 (Patch)

## [1.9.0] - 2026-03-04

**Category**: Universal Trigger-Rate Optimization & Skill-Creator Enhancement

### Changed (Skills — All Categories)

- **🎯 Pushy Descriptions (228 skills)**: Applied explicit `"Use when…"` trigger clause to every skill description across all 21 categories. Previously passive descriptions (e.g., "Standards for WorkManager and Background Processing") now include concrete activation contexts (e.g., "Use when implementing background tasks, scheduled work, or long-running operations in Android."), making agents more reliably activate the correct skill from the description alone.
- **🧪 `common/skill-creator`**: Improved to cover test generation, regression catching, and trigger-rate measurement & optimization:
  - Added **Test, Measure & Iterate** section with a 5-step validation workflow targeting ≥80% trigger accuracy.
  - Added 6 new trigger keywords: `test skill`, `eval skill`, `trigger rate`, `optimize description`, `skill regression`, `improve skill`.
  - New `references/testing.md`: Documents `evals/evals.json` schema, should-trigger / should-not-trigger query design, "pushy" description optimization (before/after examples), and regression-catching protocol.
  - Updated `references/lifecycle.md` Phase 4: validation checklist now requires eval cases and ≥80% trigger-rate target.

### Fixed (CLI)

- **🔀 `AgentBridgeService` Newline Bug**: Fixed `.join('\\n')` → `.join('\n')` so all generated rule files (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, `.github/instructions/*.md`, `.agent/rules/*.md`, etc.) now contain real line breaks instead of literal `\n` sequences. The entire rule body was previously collapsed into a single unformatted line, making the Skill Activation Protocol nearly unparseable by agents.
- **📋 Skill Activation Protocol**: Updated the generated rule body content with an explicit 4-step ordered checklist replacing the passive "ALWAYS consult AGENTS.md" instruction, ensuring agents follow a deterministic skill-loading sequence.

**Category**: Agent Detection Restoration & Rule Integrity

### Fixed (CLI)

- **🛡️ Agent Detection**: Restored the logic to only generate rule files if an agent is actually detected in the project (e.g., `.cursor`, `.clauderules`, etc.). This prevents polluting projects with unused configuration folders.
- **🧪 Test Coverage**: Re-introduced and verified unit tests for agent detection skips and hits.

### Versions

- **CLI**: v1.8.2 (Patch)

## [1.8.1] - 2026-03-02

**Category**: Agent Bridge Dynamic Path Correction & Logic Optimization

### Fixed (CLI)

- **🔄 Dynamic Rule Links**: Fixed hardcoded `../skills/` links in generated agent rules. The self-learning protocol now uses a dynamically calculated relative path to the `/skills` folder, ensuring correct navigation for all agents (Cursor, Claude, Copilot, etc.).
- **🧹 Logic Optimization**: Removed redundant agent detection check in `AgentBridgeService` to improve performance and consistency.
- **🧪 Test Hardening**: Updated `AgentBridgeService.spec.ts` with specific assertions for dynamic pathing across different agent configurations.

### Versions

- **CLI**: v1.8.1 (Patch)

## [1.8.0] - 2026-03-02

**Category**: Common Skills Gap Closure & CLI Smart Exclusions

### Added (Skills)

- **♿ `common/accessibility`**: New P1 skill — WCAG 2.2 Level AA standards for web UI agents: semantic HTML, ARIA usage rules, keyboard navigation, color contrast ratios, and CI testing gate (`axe-core`). Scoped to frontend file patterns (`*.tsx`, `*.jsx`, `*.html`, `*.vue`, `*.component.html`).
- **📡 `common/api-design`**: New P1 skill — REST API conventions covering HTTP verb semantics, status code correctness, URL design, versioning strategy, cursor-based pagination, and OpenAPI 3.1 contract requirements. Scoped to controller/router/handler file patterns.
- **🛡️ `common/error-handling`**: New P1 skill — Cross-cutting error design standards: HTTP error response envelope, error classification by layer, wrapping vs. replacement rules, boundary placement, and error code naming. Scoped to service/handler/controller backend file patterns.
- **📊 `common/observability`**: New P1 skill — Backend observability standards: structured JSON logging (required fields), OpenTelemetry distributed tracing (W3C `traceparent`), metric naming conventions, SLO definitions, and correlation ID propagation. Scoped to backend service file patterns.
- **🧠 `common/session-retrospective`**: New meta-skill — Self-learning protocol for AI agents. At the end of any multi-step task with user corrections, the agent analyzes the conversation to detect skill gaps, missing rules, or violated standards, then proposes targeted skill improvements to prevent repeat rework. Includes `references/methodology.md`.
- **🛠️ `common/skill-creator`**: New meta-skill — Standards for creating new high-density agent skills with optimal token economy. Includes `references/TEMPLATE.md` (scaffold), `references/lifecycle.md` (review → publish flow), and `references/resource-organization.md` (when and how to use `references/` sub-files).
- **📐 `common/system-design` references**: Added `references/distributed-systems.md` (CAP theorem, consistency models, event-driven patterns) and `references/resilience-patterns.md` (circuit breakers, bulkheads, idempotency) — keeping the primary SKILL.md lean while providing depth.

### Changed (Skills)

- **🔧 Trigger Hardening**: Added file-glob triggers to `common/best-practices`, `common/security-standards`, `common/performance-engineering`, and `common/tdd` — these foundational skills now fire automatically on source file edits, not just keyword matches.
- **⚡ `common/performance-engineering`**: Elevated from P1 to P0 — performance regressions have direct business impact equivalent to security issues.
- **✅ `common/tdd`**: Expanded with minimum coverage threshold (80%), AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert) structure guidance, language-specific runner commands, and mock-vs-real dependency decision rules.
- **🌐 `AGENTS.md`**: Added conflict resolution protocol — when two skills conflict, apply the more specific skill (framework > language > common); same-specificity conflicts defer to `common/security-standards` for security and `common/best-practices` for design decisions.

### Fixed (Security)

- **🔐 `golang/security`**: Enforced Argon2id over bcrypt for password hashing — harmonized with `nestjs/security` for consistent polyglot security posture. Added explicit `RS256` / `HS256` JWT algorithm enforcement and `none` rejection.
- **🍪 `typescript/security`**: Fixed `NODE_ENV === 'prod'` (always `false` in production) → `NODE_ENV === 'production'` in secure cookie configuration, preventing cookies being transmitted over HTTP in production deployments.

### Changed (Framework Skills)

- **🧪 `flutter/testing`**: Major rewrite of testing skill and all references. Added `test-organization.md` (new), `widget-keys.md` (new), significantly expanded `robot-pattern.md`, `widget-testing.md`, `integration-testing.md`, and `mocking_standards.md` with up-to-date patterns.
- **🧪 `nestjs/testing`**: Added `improve-coverage.md` and `strict-typescript-testing.md` reference files. Updated `patterns.md` with additional test patterns.
- **⚛️ `react/state-management`**: Clarified skill boundary — `hooks` skill covers primitive API usage (`useMemo`, `useCallback`); this skill covers architectural state decisions (Context, Zustand, Redux). Added `useMemo` on context value guidance. Removed overlapping Anti-Patterns section.
- **🔐 `golang/security`**: Enforced Argon2id (time=1, memory=64MB, threads=4) over bcrypt. Added `RS256`/`HS256` JWT algorithm enforcement with `none` rejection for multi-service auth.
- **🍪 `typescript/security`**: Fixed `NODE_ENV === 'production'` cookie guard.

### Added (CLI)

- **📦 Framework-aware common skill exclusions**: `ags init` now auto-populates `common.exclude` in `.skillsrc` based on the detected framework type, eliminating irrelevant skills from agent context:
  - **Backend** (NestJS, Go, Spring Boot, Laravel): excludes `accessibility`, `mobile-animation`, `mobile-ux-core`
  - **Frontend** (React, Next.js, Angular): excludes `observability`, `mobile-animation`, `mobile-ux-core`
  - **Mobile** (Flutter, Android, iOS, React Native): excludes `accessibility`, `api-design`, `observability`
- **`getFrameworkType()` helper**: New exported function in `constants/` — classifies any framework ID into `'backend' | 'frontend' | 'mobile' | null`. Replaces inline nested ternary in `ConfigService`.
- **`FRONTEND_FRAMEWORKS`, `MOBILE_FRAMEWORKS` constants**: Explicit framework category arrays for React/Angular/Next.js and Flutter/Android/iOS/React Native respectively.
- **New tests**: `constants/__tests__/index.spec.ts` (5 tests for `getFrameworkType`); 9 new `ConfigService` tests covering exclusion correctness per framework type including edge cases (unknown framework, missing common metadata).
